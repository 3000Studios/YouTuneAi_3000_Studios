## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Open Public Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### 2. Report Privately

Send details to: **security@3000studios.com**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-14 days
  - Medium: 14-30 days
  - Low: 30-90 days

### 4. Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** policy:
- We'll work with you to understand and fix the issue
- We request you wait for our fix before public disclosure
- We'll credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We'll publish a security advisory after the fix is released

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**
   - All inputs are validated and sanitized
   - File type restrictions enforced
   - Path traversal prevention

2. **Malware Detection**
   - Pattern-based scanning
   - Dangerous code detection
   - Suspicious file identification

3. **Zip Safety**
   - Zip bomb prevention
   - Compression ratio checks
   - Size limit enforcement

4. **Integrity Verification**
   - SHA256 hash generation
   - Automatic verification
   - Tamper detection

5. **Container Security**
   - Non-root user execution
   - Read-only filesystem
   - Minimal attack surface
   - Security hardening

### Automated Security

- **Daily Security Scans**: Automated via GitHub Actions
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety and Dependabot
- **Code Analysis**: Bandit, CodeQL
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Always Verify Themes**
   ```bash
   theme-manager scan ./theme
   theme-manager validate ./theme
   ```

2. **Check Integrity**
   - Verify SHA256 hashes
   - Only use themes from trusted sources

3. **Keep Updated**
   - Update to latest version regularly
   - Enable automatic updates if possible

4. **Use Security Features**
   - Enable security scanning
   - Review validation reports
   - Monitor logs

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding**
   - Follow OWASP guidelines
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize outputs
   - Use parameterized queries (future DB feature)

2. **Testing**
   - Write security tests
   - Test edge cases
   - Perform penetration testing

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review dependency security
   - Use lock files

4. **Code Review**
   - All code must be reviewed
   - Security-focused review for sensitive areas
   - Automated security checks must pass

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **File Magic Detection**: Uses basic file type detection
   - Recommendation: Manual review of themes from untrusted sources

2. **Pattern Matching**: Security scanner uses regex patterns
   - Recommendation: May have false positives/negatives

3. **No Network Isolation**: Themes may contain network requests
   - Recommendation: Use network policies or firewalls

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Sandboxed execution environment
- [ ] Machine learning-based malware detection
- [ ] Real-time threat intelligence integration
- [ ] Advanced static analysis
- [ ] Dynamic analysis capabilities
